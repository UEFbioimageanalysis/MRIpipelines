# MRIpipelines
This repository contains example pipelines to run different T1w-MRI processing tools in an HPC-like environment. 
These are intended to serve as examples how to do process anatomical MRI data on the UEF bioinformatics servers, but might be useful for also others not using UEF servers.
These pipelines assume that the server runs slurm workload manager. They also utilize snakemake workflow management system.

Jussi Tohka, Teemu MÃ¤ki-Maunus, Raimo Salo, and Ali Farki have contributed to these pipelines.
